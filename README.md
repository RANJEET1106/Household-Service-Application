### üõ†Ô∏è Install and Run

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/RANJEET1106/Household-Service-Application>
    cd <path to the directory>
    ```


2. **Install dependencies** using the `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


3. **Run the Flask app**:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    By default, this will run the app on `http://localhost:5000`.

4. **Add Webhook URL**  
   In the `task.py` file at line 12, update the Webhook URL. The Webhook is used to send notifications/alerts to a third-party service when certain tasks are completed. Make sure to replace the placeholder URL with your actual Webhook URL:

   ```python
   WEBHOOK_URL = "<Enter Your Webhook URL>"  # Update with your actual Webhook URL
   ```

5. **Run Celery Worker** (in a separate terminal):

    ```bash
    python -m celery -A task worker --loglevel=info
    ```

6. **Run Celery Beat** (for periodic tasks like scheduled jobs):

    ```bash
    python -m celery -A task beat --loglevel=info
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Celery Setup

Celery is **officially supported on Linux and Mac** environments. While it can be run on **Windows**, it requires workarounds due to Windows‚Äô limitations with the `multiprocessing` module. Specifically, the **prefork** pool used by Celery doesn't work natively on Windows, and alternatives like the **"solo"** pool are single-threaded and suitable only for development purposes.

#### üíª Platform Recommendation:
- **Linux and Mac** are the recommended platforms for running Celery in production for better performance and scalability.
- **Windows**: Celery can run on Windows, but it may require using the **"solo"** pool, which is limited and not ideal for production.

For this project, **Celery was used on a Linux environment** to ensure optimal performance and compatibility
